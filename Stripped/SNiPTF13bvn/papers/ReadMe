Abstract:
    Supernova (SN) iPTF13bvn in NGC 5806 was the first Type Ib SN to have
    been tentatively associated with a progenitor in pre-explosion images.
    We performed deep ultraviolet (UV) and optical Hubble Space Telescope
    observations of the SN site ~740 days after explosion. We detect an
    object in the optical bands that is fainter than the pre-explosion
    object. This dimming is likely not produced by dust absorption in the
    ejecta; thus, our finding confirms the connection of the progenitor
    candidate with the SN. The object in our data is likely dominated by
    the fading SN, implying that the pre-SN flux is mostly due to the
    progenitor. We compare our revised pre-SN photometry with previously
    proposed models. Although binary progenitors are favored, models need
    to be refined. In particular, to comply with our deep UV detection
    limit, any companion star must be less luminous than a late-O star or
    substantially obscured by newly formed dust. A definitive progenitor
    characterization will require further observations to disentangle the
    contribution of a much fainter SN and its environment.

Description:
    We obtained deep imaging of the field of iPTF13bvn ~740 days after
    explosion using HST through Cycle 22 programs GO-13684 and GO-13822.
    Program GO-13684 was executed between 2015 June 26.37 and 26.60 (UT
    dates are used herein) with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) UVIS
    channel. Program GO-13822 comprised observations obtained on 2015 June
    30.63 with WFC3/UVIS (F225W filter) and on June 30.90 UT with the
    Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS; F814W filter).
    The supernova (SN) location in the pre- and post-explosion images was
    found by aligning them relative to a F555W image obtained through
    program GO-12888 with WFC3/UVIS on 2013 September 2.37 when the SN was
    still very bright.

    We also obtained BVRI imaging of iPTF13bvn until ~280 days with the
    Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) and the 1m Nickel telescope
    at Lick Observatory (see table 3). Apparent magnitudes were first
    measured in the KAIT4 natural system and then transformed to the
    standard system using local calibrators and color terms as given in
    Table 4 of Ganeshalingam et al. (2010, J/ApJS/190/418).
